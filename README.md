SkypeMagic
==========

A Skype bot

Meant for personal use.
You need System.Data.SQLite installed on your system. Probably the x64 variant.
The Skype class requires you to specify a path to the database file and the name of the conversation you want the bot to write in.
Open up the Bot class to see how to use it.

Good luck.
