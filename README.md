A Skype bot

Meant for personal use.
The Skype class requires you to specify a path to the database file and the name of the conversation you want the bot to write in.
Open up the Bot class to see how to use it.

The Bot class has runtime scripting support. Scripts are placed in the 'scripts' folder.
There is a secondary Scripts project that makes it easier to develop scripts in Visual Studio. To use them,
you need to copy the source files into 'bin/scripts' of the main project.

Good luck.
